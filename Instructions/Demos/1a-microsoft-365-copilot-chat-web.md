### **Step 1: Gather Insights from the Web**

Let’s start by asking Copilot to research a key metric. In the **Copilot Chat** prompt field, input:

```
What is the ratio of EV cars to EV chargers by region in the US for the past 3 years? Please show it in a table organized by region.
```

### **Step 2: Analyze Your Sales Data**

Now let’s compare national trends to your company’s sales performance. You’ll upload the provided dataset and ask Copilot to visualize the data:

1. In the prompt field, type:
   ```
   I need to know the quarterly trends for each of our sales regions. Create a quarterly revenue line graph for the past 2 years based on:
   ```
2. Select **Add Content** and upload [**Charger_sales_report_2022-2024.xlsx**](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/MS-4012-Microsoft-Copilot-Unlocked/raw/master/Resourcefiles/Charger_sales_report_2022-2024.xlsx).

### **Step 3: Drive Strategic Decisions**

Let’s take it a step further by asking Copilot for recommendations:

1. After the graph is generated, input:
   ```
   Based on the trend, suggest two ways I can increase EV charger sales in the Mountain and Midwest regions.
   ```

Copilot enables iterative analysis, allowing you to refine strategies and prioritize actions for underperforming areas.
